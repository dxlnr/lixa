# Scraping 

For now there is the possibility to download the instagram posts of a profil using [instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io/index.html).

Run inside the `bare.py` file:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    scrape_insta(profil_name="nike")
```

## Longterm Alternative

Advanced web scraping techniques with Puppeteer and BrightData's scraping browser.
